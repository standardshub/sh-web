Formation
From a community specification that does not require a legal entity to a full service, world-wide specification body, setting up the right governance structure, the right pricing structure, and the right membership privileges are important decisions that need to be made early in the formation process.


International consortia have legal and regulatory complexities that are not present with start-up companies.  Our team understands these intricacies and can help ensure you set up correctly from day one.


We can help you frame the mission and we can connect you with legal practitioners who have deep experience in consortia formation, IPR, copyright, and source code licensing so that your association starts out on a firm, practical footing.
